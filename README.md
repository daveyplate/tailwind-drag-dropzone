# DragDropzone Component

The `DragDropzone` component is a versatile and highly customizable React component designed to allow users to drag and drop files for upload. It leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, and `react-dropzone` for handling the dropzone functionality. 

## Installation

```bash
npm install @daveyplate/tailwind-drag-dropzone
```

Ensure you have Tailwind CSS configured properly in your project.

## Usage

```jsx
import { DragDropzone } from '@daveyplate/tailwind-drag-dropzone'

function App() {
    const openRef = React.useRef()

    const handleFiles = (files) => {
        console.log('Files:', files)
        // Handle file processing here
    }

    const handleError = (error) => {
        console.error('Error:', error)
        // Handle error processing here
    }

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <DragDropzone
                size="md"
                label="Upload Files"
                openRef={openRef}
                accept={{ 'image/*': [] }}
                maxFiles={3}
                onFiles={handleFiles}
                onError={handleError}
            >
                <div>Drag your files here or click to upload.</div>
            </DragDropzone>
        </div>
    )
}
```
